# Cesar

It is one of the practical project of "[Opanuj JavaScript](https://przeprogramowani.pl/kurs-javascript/)" course.


You can find more specifically information about this project [here](https://przeprogramowani.pl/opanuj_javascript-szyfr_cezara.pdf). I have added some extra features, for example possibility to choose ROT.

You can download/clone this repo and see the fruits of my work or just click [here](https://mb-dir.github.io/Cesar/). If you want to run the application on your machine you have to remember about using live server for example from VS code, because I use the [ES Modules](https://javascript.info/modules-intro#what-is-a-module).
